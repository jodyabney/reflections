What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git establishes the metadata necessary to track the changes in my directory. I need to setup git to track the changes in my directory because git won't track it unless I've set it up first.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The repository is where the commits are handled/stored based on items added to the staging area from the working directory. The staging area provides control over what files get added in a commit. The working directory contains all the files you might add to a repository via commits.
