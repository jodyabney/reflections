What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git establishes the metadata necessary to track the changes in my directory. I need to setup git to track the changes in my directory because git won't track it unless I've set it up first.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The repository is where the commits are handled/stored based on items added to the staging area from the working directory. The staging area provides control over what files get added in a commit. The working directory contains all the files you might add to a repository via commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use git diff --staged to check the changes staged versus the latest commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When I want to experiment with a new feature/change without impacting my already working version. Branching allows me to create a new copy and work on that copy without impacting my already working version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams always help me because I'm a visual learner. These diagrams make it much easier to understand the concept of an unreachable commit (one not associated with a branch).

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
